Plugin adding a command that opens user settings in the chat

# 

__Experiment:__
This plugin is just a demo experiment that takes output to the next level.  No support promised

__For devs:__
Here I use a small hack, where I inject directly into Embed and catch my component and render, since this is a hack, I would not recommend actively using it, I hope it will work out of the box in v3
